Microservices Architecture Project Overview

This project showcases a complete microservices architecture with several key components designed to demonstrate modern software practices and cloud-native technologies. It includes an API Gateway, Config Server, distributed tracing with Zipkin, resilience patterns with Resilience4j, load balancing, service discovery, and service registry.

Project Components
1. API Gateway
Technology: Spring Cloud Gateway
Purpose: Manages routing of incoming requests and handles cross-cutting concerns such as security and logging.

2. Config Server
Technology: Spring Cloud Config
Purpose: Externalizes configuration for all microservices, ensuring consistent and centralized management of application properties.

3. Distributed Tracing
Technology: Zipkin
Purpose: Provides end-to-end tracing of requests across microservices, allowing for easy tracking of request flows and performance bottlenecks.

4. Resilience Patterns
Technology: Resilience4j
Purpose: Implements resilience patterns such as circuit breakers, retries, and rate limiting to enhance system robustness and fault tolerance.

5. Load Balancer
Technology: Spring Cloud LoadBalancer
Purpose: Distributes incoming requests across multiple service instances to balance load and improve system availability.

6. Feign Client
Technology: Spring Cloud OpenFeign
Purpose: Simplifies service-to-service communication by using declarative REST clients.

7. Service Discovery & Registry
Technology: Eureka
Purpose: Registers microservices dynamically, enabling service discovery and interaction between services without hardcoding service URLs.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Java 11 or later
Maven or Gradle
Docker (optional, for containerization)
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/microservices-project.git
cd microservices-project
Build and Run the Services

Gateway Service:

bash
Copy code
cd gateway-service
mvn clean install
java -jar target/gateway-service.jar
Config Server:

bash
Copy code
cd config-server
mvn clean install
java -jar target/config-server.jar
Zipkin Server:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
Other Services:

Follow similar steps for the other services, adjusting paths and commands as necessary.

Access the Application

API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
Eureka Dashboard: http://localhost:8761
Zipkin UI: http://localhost:9411
Testing

Use tools like Postman or curl to send requests to the API Gateway and verify that requests are properly routed and load balanced.

Configuration
Config Server: Configuration files are located in the config-repo directory. Update them as needed.
Application Properties: Configuration for each microservice can be found in their respective application.yml or application.properties files.
